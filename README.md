# meh-lua

The meh-assistant is getting a new language port, the first one since we shifted from Java to DOTNET, but this time they will 
both continue to develop 'async', and hopefully one day recieve all the features of MEH.NET
and will likely not be included in the MEH-Unified client - server update, kinda like what
mojang did with Java and Bedrock Mincraft
